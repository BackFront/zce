<p>Answer: <strong>A</strong></p>


<p>Explanation:</p>
<p>The not-identical equivalence operation (`!==`) evaluates to true if the two operands are not of the same data type or do not have the same value.</p>

<p>Equivalence operations in PHP</p>
<p>There are four types of equivalence operations in the PHP language:</p>

<p>`Equivalence Operation` (`==`): It evaluates to true if the two operands are equivalent, i.e., they can be converted to a common data type in which they have the same value but are not necessarily of the same type.</p>

<p>`Identity Operation` (`===`): It evaluates to true only if the operands are of the same data type and have the same value.</p>

<p>`Not-equivalent Operation` (`!=`): It evaluates to true if the two operands are not equivalent, without regards to their data type.</p>

<p>`Not-identical Operation` (`!==`): It evaluates to true if the two operands are not of the same data type or do not have the same value.</p>
